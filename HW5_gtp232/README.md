## Assignment 1: Compare Tests for Goodness of fit (on real data)




## Assignment 2: Line fitting and data munging with income gender bias.
I worked on Assignment 2 with Ben Miller and Chris Streich.




## Assignment 3: Practice formulating the null hypothesis 
I worked on Assignment 3 with Ben Miller and Chris Streich as well.

Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:


- Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise? 

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Null hypothesis: The test sample lost the same amount or less fat compared to the control sample at a significance level of 5%.

- Do American trust the president?

POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23).
Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

Null hypothesis: A majority (>%50) or greater number of Americans surveyed answered yes to "From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?" at a significance level of 5%. 

- Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking. 

Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

Null hypothesis: The cessation rates over a 6 month period for smokers assigned to the nicotine patch were the same or lower than the cessation rates over a 6 month period for placebo patch users at a significance level of 5%.

- Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. 

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

Null hypothesis: The sum of the IQs of children (whose mothers did not smoke during pregnancy) at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 were all the same or lower than the sum of the IQs of children (whose mothers did smoke during pregnancy) at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 at a significance level of 5%.
