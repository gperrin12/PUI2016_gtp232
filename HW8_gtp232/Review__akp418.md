Akshay's plot of the count of citibikes at off-street locations is interesting to me as a cyclist in New York City. The plot is well labeled, has a title, and it is relatively clear what the plot is portraying. It would be easy to manipulate this graph to show the data in a misleading way, but the scale is at an appropriate setting to not do this. The plot also has a middle to high data to ink ratio (as outlined by Tufte), which is a good thing! The legend could be compressed and the filled bars removed to increase the ratio, but overall, it's an elegant plot. It's easy to see that Route 9A Greenway at 11th St has the highest count, and all the rest are pretty low. My suggestion would be to remove the space between the bars and perhaps sort the bars in descending order, as it's a bit difficult to compare the counts against one another, as the differences are small compared to the largest bar.
