# HW11 - README


### Roles:

I worked on Assignments 1 & 2 with Ben Miller.

### Assignment 1:

In assignment 1 we used a NYC Census Tract shapefile to find out in which tract CUSP is located.

### Assignment 2:

In assignment two we used time series of establishments by NYC zipcode to look at trends and clusterings of establishments (by zipcode) using US census data from 1994 to 2014. Ben was a big help in figuring out the big picture ideas of how to cluster time series, in addition to many more things.
