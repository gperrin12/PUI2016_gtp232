# My review of Geoff's plot exercise.

Haha first plot "should surprise absolutely no one". Glad I found that in there, was wondering...

![Geoff's Second Plot](/HW7_gtp232/Geoff's Second Plot.png?raw=true "Geoff's Second Plot")

## CLARITY
Both plots are clear. In the first plot, points could be labeled something like "properties" instead of "data". That the x axis in both plots is units "per building" could be slightly more clear. That might have taken a minute to figure out if I hadn't read the whole notebook before that. Could be more specific than "model line" in second plot, though the markdown below explains it.

## AESTHETICS
First plot has an overlapping problem with the title that I've also had. Otherwise good.

## HONESTY
Maybe tell us a little more about why you mention the assessor's policy about coops and condos and then do this analysis. What's the connection? I think I get it but you could state it explicitly. Did you go in with a hypothesis? (sorry if I missed it)
